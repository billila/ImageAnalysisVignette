# Introduction 
This vignette provides an overview of the workflow for analyzing high-resolution diagnostic images and features derived from TCGA datasets, using modern computational tools.

# TCGA Data 

The images can be downloaded using the `GDCdatacommon` package with the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example GDCdatacommon code for downloading images
library(GDCdatacommon)
gdc_download(
  ids = "your_image_ids_here",
  directory = "path_to_save"
)
```


spigare da dove escono le diagnostic  alta risoluzione e spiegare la differenza con quelle a bassa risoluzione.




# imageTCGA 

The `imageTCGA` is a Shiny application package designed for interactive visualization and management of image metadata. It provides:
- Dynamic tables with image information.
- Download options for selected images.


# HoVer-Net 


## Introduction

HoVer-Net is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for cell segmentation and classification. The input to HoVer-Net is `.svs` format images, typically derived from H&E-stained slides. HoVer-Net is based on the **Pancancer Atlas** and leverages modern neural network architectures to achieve precise segmentation and classification.

## Outputs

### JSON Structure Explanation
![Example of HoVer-Net Output](hovernet_output.png)

- **mag**: This typically indicates the magnification level of the slide. In this case, it's set to 40.

- **nuc**: This is a dictionary containing the detected nuclei. Each key (like 1, 2, etc.) represents a unique nucleus detected in the image.

Each nucleus entry contains:

  - **bbox**: The bounding box coordinates of the nucleus, represented as two points (top-left and bottom-right).
  - **centroid**: The coordinates of the centroid of the nucleus, which is the center point calculated based on the contour.
  - **contour**: A list of points that outline the shape of the nucleus. This is useful for visualizing the exact shape and boundaries of the detected nucleus.
  - **type_prob**: The probability associated with the type of the nucleus, indicating the model's confidence in its classification.
  - **type**: This typically represents the class label assigned to the nucleus (e.g., different types of cells or states).

#### Example Interpretation
For example, for nucleus "1":

- **Bounding Box**: The nucleus is located within the coordinates given by `[[15892, 64768], [15912, 64804]]`.
- **Centroid**: The center of this nucleus is at `[15633, 65054]`.
- **Contour**: The shape of the nucleus is defined by the series of points listed in the "contour" array.
- **Type Probability**: The model is very confident (close to 1.0) that this is of type 3.
- **Type**: Type 3. HoVer-Net was used on patches from each class separately to segment and classify the nuclei into 5 different types: benign epithelial, neoplastic, inflammatory/immune, necrotic, and stromal.


All computations for HoVer-Net were performed on the **Jetstream Cloud Platform**.

## Feature Extraction
The extracted features include:

- **Cell counts**
- **Cell type distributions**
- **Spatial patterns**

Features are stored in an `.h5ad` format for downstream single-cell and spatial analyses.

# Prov-Giga Path 

## Introduction 
Prov-Giga Path is a framework designed for embedding diagnostic image data into lower-dimensional spaces for visualization and analysis. 

## Embeddings
Embeddings are generated using unsupervised learning techniques, optimized for high-resolution pathology data.

# Case Study 

## Purity and Ploidy 
Data for tumor purity and ploidy were downloaded from TCGA. The analysis correlates these metrics with imaging features to understand tumor heterogeneity.
