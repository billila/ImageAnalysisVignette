# ImageAnalysisVignette

`ImageAnalysisVignette` outlines a workflow for analyzing high-resolution histopathological images and features from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It integrates Python-based tools with R/Bioconductor to extract, store, and analyze features like cell counts and spatial patterns. The imageTCGA Shiny app enables interactive exploration, filtering, and visualization of data. Case studies demonstrate the repository's potential for advancing cancer research through integrated histopathology and multi-omics analyses.
